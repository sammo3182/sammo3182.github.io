      <description>Individuals are not passive in their responses to the dominant cultural actions of their own and other countries. Despite appearing significantly weaker in the face of powerful state propaganda machinery, they retain sufficient agency to identify and understand political propaganda, and to some extent, influence its impact on themselves. We are particularly interested in how this process from the macro to the micro level is realized. This interest distinguishes our research team&amp;rsquo;s perspective from the political communication and political socialization studies that focus primarily on the state side and commnicational paths.</description>
